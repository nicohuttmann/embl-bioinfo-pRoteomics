# Preface {-}

Hi friends, and welcome to __Introduction to Data Analysis and Visualization in R__. This document contains all explanations and other material for our group project and was produced in RStudio using an RMarkdown document which was then 'knitted' into an html file. We'll maybe get there later.^[I am sitting on a train to Munich right now, because I overcommited to a birthday party without knowing where it happens - similar to hosting this group work, but this time coffee was involved. I just recorded the first three videos for this tutorial. You don't need to watch these videos. They are meant to go back to, if you are unsure how to navigate RStudio. It is simple to transfer code, but which buttons to click is a bit more tideous. Feel free to skip through them.]


## Group work structure {-}

Ok, enough bla. This document will live in the course folder alongside all the other materials like the PowerPoint presentation that will guide us through the sections as a group, some code, the raw data and maybe other stuff. 

ADD IMAGE or something

The first chapters of this document under __R Basics__ (on the left) will provide a short introduction to coding in R. Parts of it reference the book [R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz). It is a great resource for everyone from beginner to expert. I recommend it no matter what, but if you are relatively new to R in this course, go through it over these days and use the opportunity to discuss concepts from the book in the group setting. The first 2.5 h session on Tuesday should suffice to get everyone on the same page and ready to start exploring some real data in the __Group Work Project__.

You can go through our project individually or in groups. In any case, I do recommend putting the code down in an R script by yourself no matter how. For each step, the problem we are facing will be will be described alongside the final goal. Then, you can either figure out the code entirely on your own, use a hint, or copy the complete code snippet into your document and then run it. The latter option comes close to how many problems in coding are being solved - define the problem, google it, find the answer on StackOverflow and copy it into your script. Yay, you're a data scientist now!





<!-- ## Blocks -->

<!-- ## Equations -->

<!-- Here is an equation. -->

<!-- \begin{equation}  -->
<!--   f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k} -->
<!--   (\#eq:binom) -->
<!-- \end{equation}  -->

<!-- You may refer to using `\@ref(eq:binom)`, like see Equation \@ref(eq:binom). -->


<!-- ## Theorems and proofs -->

<!-- Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using `\@ref(thm:tri)`, for example, check out this smart theorem \@ref(thm:tri). -->

<!-- ::: {.theorem #tri} -->
<!-- For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the *length* of the hypotenuse -->
<!-- and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the **other** two sides, we have -->
<!-- $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ -->
<!-- ::: -->

<!-- Read more here <https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html>. -->

<!-- ## Callout blocks -->


<!-- The `bs4_book` theme also includes special callout blocks, like this `.rmdnote`. -->

<!-- ::: {.rmdnote} -->
<!-- You can use **markdown** inside a block. -->

<!-- ```{r collapse=TRUE} -->
<!-- head(beaver1, n = 5) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ::: -->

<!-- It is up to the user to define the appearance of these blocks for LaTeX output.  -->

<!-- You may also use: `.rmdcaution`, `.rmdimportant`, `.rmdtip`, or `.rmdwarning` as the block name. -->


<!-- The R Markdown Cookbook provides more help on how to use custom blocks to design your own callouts: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html -->
